# Manager Readme

Hi.

If you‚Äôre reading this, it means you‚Äôre a part of the team. This document will 
introduce you my management style and expectations from you. 

This README is incomplete. It sets my expectations from you and a baseline for
your expectations from me. If you feel like some of the points in this 
document are obscured, please tell me. I would like to know if you were
expecting to read something here that wasn‚Äôt found too.

## My Expectations

My definition of ‚ÄúDone‚Äù is defined by the task orientation:

* Bug - it‚Äôs not done until it‚Äôs not deployed
* Customer request (e.g. for POC) / related issue - not done until the customer 
  has the message delievered
* Development - merged and deployed before the end of the sprint (it‚Äôs up to you deploy it)

My biggest expectation from you is your *own* ability to push tasks, if something
is broken (e.g., you're blocked, the process is wrong), I'm here to help.

I don't want to reach a state where I need to test your work, you should 
test your stories and tasks and you can utilize any other team members 
that will love to try to break your work üòÄ.

## 1:1s

A bi-weekly 1:1 where we‚Äôll talk on anything which is not task/sprint related. 
We‚Äôll talk about your challenges and goals, give each other feedback and I‚Äôll 
try to provide context for things that are not clear. 

If there is something you want to share with me which can‚Äôt wait to the next 
1:1, you can take me aside and let me know. Sending a message in slack is also 
an option, but that might not be private as we use do to a lot of pair 
programming and reviews - my screen / WhatsApp / Slack / SMS are not a private 
place. If we‚Äôre not in the same place, you can always call me, I might not 
always answer - as I don‚Äôt expect from you to always be available.

These meetings are there to give you dedicated time and place to ask and talk 
about anything.

* Talk about things that you might not bring up in a group setting, I want our 
  1:1s to be a safe and private place, if this isn‚Äôt the case, please let my 
  bosses know about it
* You can bring your own agenda to 1:1s, my agenda is to talk about career 
  development, rate the company/your position for KPIs (How much did you learn 
  in the last two weeks, Are you outside of your comfort zone, etc...) and give 
  each other feedback
* As I will talk about things I‚Äôm not happy about and give you feedback, I 
  expect from you to do the same
* Urgent matters should not wait for 1:1s

## Career Development

Your career is yours, I'm offering my honest feedback on everything. My goal
is to keep you next to me and in order to do so I'll do my best to help you
grow.
